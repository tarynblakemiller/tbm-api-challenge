##Description

A simple API using Node.js, Express, MySQL, and Redis that allows you to create, list, and delete comment data. 


## Testing Steps 

* From your terminal window, `npm install` to install the dependencies.
* There is a very simple seed file `seed.js` that you can populate your database with by running the command `node seed.js`
* You should be able to make GET, POST, and DELETE requests to the `localhost:5000/comments` endpoint and see the changes reflected in your data
